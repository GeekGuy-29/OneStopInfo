## What is this project here

 Firstly, the purpose of this project is typically of building a website, more like a library, a One-Stop-Info place wherein people can find anything according to their requirement.

## What to contribute in 

There are many places, where you can contribute.

If I list them for you, they are.

1. Low-Code files
2. Non-Code files
3. Heavy-Code files

Ya ya I know, you are very confused, buddy! I got you <3

#### Low-Code files

     All the `.json` files are low-code files, they have a specific order of data and info so you can have a look at them and make your contributions there

#### Non-Code files

     Although these files aren't that legitimate enough until you make a good and hefty contribution to them but nevermind, it's there for you to put in your offering. 
     So, the non-code files for now are `Readme.md` and `Contributing.md`

#### Heavy-Code files

     If you're a newbie and don't know anything about web-dev, i am sorry mate but these aren't for you.
     So these files are the files required to covert this project into a working website. These files are `script.js` and `project.html`
